## :bug: Report bugs or other issues
If you're running into bugs or other problems, feel free to open an issue on our [issue tracker](https://github.com/Gilded-Games/The-Aether-II/issues). When doing so, we ask that you provide the following information:

- The exact version of the Aether you are running, such as `1.10.2-1.0.0`, and the version of Forge you are using, such as `14.23.5.2768`. Please do not state "the latest stable release" or "latest Forge".
- If your issue is a bug or otherwise unexpected behavior, state what you expected to happen.
- If your issue is a crash, attach the latest client or server log and the complete crash report as a file.
- If your issue only occurs with other mods/plugins installed, list the exact mod/plugin versions installed.

Make sure to keep your issue's description clear and concise. Your issue's title should also be easy to digest, giving our developers and reporters a good idea of what's wrong without including too many details. Failure to follow any of the above may result in your issue being closed.

Our reporters and developers work around the clock, and will take care of debugging, labeling, and sorting your issues. However, please note that there are currently _many_ open issues, and that it may take some time (up to a few weeks in the worst case) for your issue to be triaged and resolved. Typically, issues are resolved in order of severity and complexity, not the date submitted.
