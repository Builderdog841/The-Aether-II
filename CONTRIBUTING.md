### Creating issues
We ask that you kindly search for issues that may be similar to yours before opening a new issue. Here's a handy guide to creating top-notch issues!

- Provide the exact steps required to reproduce your issue.

- If your issue is a bug, please state what you expected to happen.

- If your issue is a crash, attach the latest client/server log and crash report.

- If your issue only occurs with other mods/plugins installed, please list the exact mod/plugin versions installed.

You should keep your issue description clear and concise. Your issue's title should also be easy to digest, giving our developers a good idea of what's wrong without including too many details. 

### Creating merge requests
When contributing source code changes to the Aether, it is **mandatory** to keep consistent use of the formatting templates found in `code_formatters/`.

Furthermore, your merge request should contain the following details:

- An overview of the changes your merge request makes.

- A link to an open issue your merge request resolves, if applicable.

Additionally, if your merge request includes multiple commits, please squash them before submitting a MR.

Due to the rapid development pace of the Aether Rewrite, we're currently not accepting merge requests of which are purely content additions.
